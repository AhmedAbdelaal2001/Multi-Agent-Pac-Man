# Multi-Agent-Pac-Man
Implementation of AI agents for the classic version of the Pac-Man game utilizing minimax and expectimax search, coupled with a uniquely crafted evaluation function. Agents include Pac-Man itself, as well as all of its adversarial agents (ghosts). The goal is to have Pac-Man eat all the food in the maze, without being eaten by the ghosts.
